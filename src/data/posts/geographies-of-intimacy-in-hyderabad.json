Thiswas  followed by a CCTV footage of a young couple which went viral on social media. The news report also said that the station where this happened was being identified to take necessary action. The news also reported the official comment made by the metro authorities ‘We will investigate and take preventive steps.’ Sign boards of ‘maintain sobriety’ were installed in some of the metro stations after this event. This instance gives an entry into the problematic this essay tries to address– of ‘spaces of intimacy’. What kind of spaces does the city of Hyderabad allow for intimacies? What is considered acceptable and what is considered to be warranting ‘preventive measures’? What is the relationship between the idea of ‘sobriety’ and public spaces? How does the city change for people of different genders and sexual orientations? To explore these questions to their full potential is to draw a genealogy of public spaces and that of spaces which enable, proscribe and police various kinds of intimacies. This essay attempts to raise some questions in that direction. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Oxford Dictionary defines intimacy as ‘close familiarity or friendship’, ‘a cosy and private or relaxed atmosphere’ and euphemistically ‘sexual intercourse’. It means a wide variety of things to people. In this essay I focus on the space aspect of it, keeping the ambiguity in the word “intimacy” intact. The incident discussed above clearly points to the lens through which intimacies are looked at. A dip into the archive of Hyderabad from Telugu cinema also points in a similar direction. In majority of Telugu films that narrate a heterosexual romance, peculiarly most things intimate happen in dream/fantasy sequences in foreign locales; it is almost impossible to imagine the ‘real’ city to allow space for intimacy, except outside the domestic space. In those rare instances when there is an intimate act in public, it is often associated with guilt. For example, in the film _Love Story_, a woman kisses a man in a crowded Hyderabad metro and the first instinct of the man is to look around guiltily. Perhaps, the man was scared of the moral policing gaze of the onlookers, policing of the metro security, being captured by one of the thousands of CCTV cameras in the Hyderabad city, or being charged with public nuisance. \r\n\r\n\r\nHyderabad today ranks in the top twenty most surveilled cities in the world. It has 480 CCTV cameras per every square kilometre. In fact, the command control centre promises 360 degree views of the city from the CCTV cameras. In a city which is policed so much, where one is watched constantly, where do the spaces of intimacy exist? This question also hints at the boundaries between the public and private. What becomes acceptable in public and what is considered to be a nuisance? Most importantly, it is also about the right to public spaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Quora App, a crowdsourced information sharing platform, has many interesting questions such as ‘Where can couples kiss in Hyderabad?’, ‘Where can I take my girlfriend in Hyderabad for privacy?’, ‘What are the best theatre for lovers in Hyderabad and full privacy?’, ‘Which hotel allows unmarried couple to make love in Hyderabad?’ which open up the geographies of intimacy in Hyderabad. The answers to these questions range from naming specific places such as Taramati Baradari, Botanical Gardens, Rock formations on Outer Ring Road, empty streets etc. to a few people cautioning others that they should think twice before attempting any such activity, as Hyderabad is a very conservative place. Some answers make direct reference to police interference and give tips to the seekers on how to avoid trouble. ‘Hyderabad is still very prudish and might not take kindly to people making out…’ one answer suggests; another person cautions that they would become victims of ‘moral policing’ if they attempted any intimate activity in public spaces. In Quora, the definitions of intimacy are limited to heterosexual romance. In fact, all those who pose the questions and those who answer work only within the heteronormative framework. While the city seems to offer some possibilities to this group, the consensus is that they are severely restrained by moral policing. Many Quora answers point to businesses such as OYO rooms and Stayuncle where couples can rent rooms for a few hours. Even in these spaces, CCTV cameras are ubiquitous and hence anonymity from various kinds of policing is not guaranteed. Spaces of intimacy are a mere commodity. Those who can pay the price bypass the policing to a certain extent. The surveillance city, in restricting spaces and sanitizing the city of ‘obscenity’, fosters opportunities for new kinds of businesses with a model to provide space for intimacy, something the city vehemently denies. Those who can afford it end up buying some space for a limited period of time. In setting up spaces as commodities, the city makes all those who cannot afford it vulnerable to police violence that takes place in the name of “controlling” public nuisance. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe experience of the city differs widely depending on where on the queer spectrum one lies. The city is slightly more friendly to the cis-gendered gay men than to a trans-person. Fred, a cis-gendered gay man narrated his experience of spaces of intimacy in Hyderabad ‘It depends on the time of the day, certain spots become intimate at certain times of the day’. University spaces, bus stops, old theatres, public parks, public toilets often become cruising spots after dusk. ‘Any space can become a cruising spot” and “they are often spaces which are not frequented by women’, he said. Another site, similar to Quora, which specialises in information for gay men lists a variety of spaces such as swimming pools, specific theatres, public toilets etc. Many of the men participating in these spaces do not identify as gay or queer, intimacies between men are legitimized as homosocial activities or fun. The public spaces which take on the tint of intimacy are mostly for chance encounters. For a planned intimate activity, space becomes even more defining. Having a ‘place’ gives a certain power to the individual, many profiles of gay dating/meeting apps specifically mention ‘have place’, sometimes the profile names are themselves ‘with place’; having a place gives control over the interaction, ‘one can call the shots. If you have a place, you can choose people’, Fred said. The potential of a space to become intimate is determined by the amount of control one can exercise on it. The only sovereignty of space that the surveillance capitalist city recognizes is that of private property, a space which has been paid for, be it a hotel room as discussed above or one’s own place, private property. \r\n\r\n\r\nA common space mentioned both in case of heterosexual couples and cis-gendered gay men are private cars, cabs and sometimes autorickshaws. These are mobile spaces, a kind of non-spaces, which are created for limited period of time and are not located anywhere. In fact, these spaces are enticing because they are not located anywhere. They are liminal in the sense that a cab is a private space but it dwells in the public space such as an empty street or a parking lot. By being mobile the cabs and rickshaws can often sidestep the gaze of the police and the moral police. Cabs as spaces allow for both planned and chance encounters, sometimes the cabbies or autorickshaw drivers becoming participants in intimate chance encounters. \r\n\r\n\r\nFor queer women, like the cis-gendered women the access to public space is quite limited. Reah a cis-gendered lesbian says ‘any space can be an intimate space where there are a lot of queer people..’ they also spoke about how in order create space for intimacy they would often go out to pubs, bars or other spaces in groups. Here the community claims a certain space and makes it queer by their presence. Reah also spoke about the Latin dancing spaces in Hyderabad which make an effort to be inclusive. Restaurants, clubs, pubs have tapped into the queer market and are making efforts to make their space inclusive. Along with businesses there are also community spaces created by the LGBTQI+ community, for instance Hepzhibah Smith who belongs to the community, along with their friend have created the People’s Choice Café which aims at providing safe space for the community. There are also speak easy pubs whose attraction is being queer friendly. However, given the cost, these spaces are only available for upper classes. Naisargi N Dave (2012) writes about beauty parlours and ladies hostels as spaces of intimacy. These are spaces which allow possibility for homosexual intimacies due to the absence of the gaze of the opposite gender, like that in case of cafes for men. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn the hetero-normative world the transperson are hyper-visible and are subjected to societal gaze along withs constant monitoring by the police. As the Quora question discussed above suggest, for a space to become intimate the first filter is that of privacy, of the possibility to be ignored by the surroundings, for the transperson this becomes impossible. Transpersons do not have access to most spaces which the other cis-gendered people have. In the register of nuisance where an intimate act of cis-gendered person has a possibility of being termed as ‘nuisance’ the presence of a transperson is itself often termed as nuisance. This does not allow for any scope of intimacy in public. In case of cis-gendered queer person, homosocial spaces such as cafes, beauty parlours, hostels, public toilets hold a potential to become spaces of intimacy. These spaces act as subversive spaces within the heteronormative logic, the transpersons lie outside of this logic and hence the city does not allow for any spaces of intimacy other than the private space of the home or the liminal space of the cab. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe boundaries of what is ‘nuisance’ are porous, they shift in specific instances. For example, during the Bonalu jatra or the Balkampet Yellama jatra which attracts a lot of transpersons, intimacy in public spaces is acceptable; rather the coming together of a large number of transpersons constitutes a new non normative space which shifts the understanding of what is acceptable in public. \r\n\r\n\r\nCaste is the boundary which cuts across gender and sexuality. In the kissing scene in the metro in the film Love Story discussed in the beginning of the paper, one other critical aspect was the caste positions of those who were participating in the intimate act of kissing. The woman was from a Velama caste, a dominant caste and the man was a Dalit Christian. Their intimacy was unacceptable in the village and the city makes it possible however the shadow of caste continues to haunt them. The man was also worried that he would be hounded for being intimate with a dominant caste girl. Intimacy either in private or in public across the caste boundaries is not just frowned up but even begets violence. In May 2022, a young man was stabbed to death in Begum Bazaar for marrying outside of caste. In the same month the murder of a Dalit man for marrying an upper caste Syed girl in the city was captured on CCTV. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhen discussing intimacy, the most important category to discuss is intimacy as a livelihood activity, that of sex work. While the city allows spaces for this livelihood activity such as construction sites, graveyards, grounds, public parks, bus stops, public toilets etc. these spaces are constantly subjected to violence both by the police and by the clients.  These spaces are common between cis-gendered and trans-gendered persons who engage in this work. ‘Public nuisance’ an open category, is often imposed at the whim of police onto the intimacy workers.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmidst the various kinds of policing there also have been attempts to reclaim the public space for intimacy. There was a nationwide campaign called ‘Park mein PDA’ was run in 2015 with the hope that a culture of accepting and normalizing intimacy in public spaces will be inculcated. People were encouraged to post pictures using the hashtag #parkmeinPDA. The archive of the hashtag today reveals more rhetoric and discussion at a nationwide level than a city specific response. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe above understanding of the spaces of intimacy and the policing in the city can be contextualized in the historical transformation of the Hyderabad city. The erstwhile princely city of Hyderabad has undergone phenomenal changes over the past half century. From a Nizamian city of laid-back culture not attuned to capitalist clock time it has been reinvented as an information technology hub synchronised with the global time in the 1990s. This turn of producing the city to attract global capital went hand in hand with the making of several tourist spaces in the city. Along with the building of the Hitech-City, the 1990s saw the beautification efforts of the Hussain Sagar, the development of Buddha Poornima Project, Necklace Road and other parks around that area. This also coincided with the sanitization of the city of what was considered to be obscene and unacceptable to the ‘global tourist city’. The police and the women’s organizations cracked down on sex work (sex workers), cinemas which were suspected to be screening obscene material - blue films, posters and hoardings. These ‘obscene’ material was thought to be unsafe for women, as they promoted ‘criminal tendencies’. This project of monitoring, controlling and sanitizing the public spaces can be seen as the early predecessor to the surveillance city today. Like in many other cities, Hyderabad also saw the rise of the Hindu right in the 1990s. The likes of Bajrang Dal often hound couples and even harass them on Valentine’s Day. This year Bajrang Dal staged a protest in Abids Road that Valentine’s Day was ‘western culture’. This vaguely resonates with the anti-obscenity drive of the 1990s.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIntimacy and ‘intimacy work’ happens in the underpasses of the metros, bridges, grave yards, public toilets, spaces where the all-pervading eye of the CCTV camera does not reach. These are the spaces which do not feature in the posters of global city, spaces which would preferably be invisible or non-existent, spaces which do not serve a ‘productive’ purpose in the global city. The underpasses are not surveilled because they are not considered as spaces where the respectable dwell. These are liminal spaces which belong to the city but do not, the spaces of intimacy."},{"Type":"Bio","Text":"C.Yamini Krishna works on film history and urban history.

The footsteps \r\nof the short guard minding the stanchions,\r\nkeeping a stray couple from the night. \r\n\r\n\r\nA parrot’s drop, light as a kerchief, in the hauz, \r\nthe sandstone of the tomb suddenly rippled.\r\nThe quiet press of a band of pigeons on the \r\n\r\n\r\ndome drawn by an expert Abyssinian hand. \r\nThe guards discussing their change of duties. \r\nThe anomalous graze of a landing on a nearby \r\n\r\n\r\nair-strip. Under the rococo sky, the disturbed \r\nsleep of the Wazir-ul-Mamlak-e-Hindustan.\r\nOn my shoulder, the thin crush of your whisper."}]},{"title":"How rivers cross their cities","blocks":[{"Type":"text","Text":"Near a church in Karrada,\r\nthe Tigris takes such a sharp turn\r\nas if it doesn’t want to \r\nleave Baghdad.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lyari in Karachi\r\n(on the other hand) can’t be\r\nbothered to stay.\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough Delhi,\r\nYamuna is a moral lesson\r\nclear as day: life is tough,\r\nfirst a trough, then a crest,\r\nthen a trough.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chenab, \r\nknowing better, walks on stilts, \r\nkeeps a one-arm distance from Jhang.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ganga \r\ncovers Patna like a quilt.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Gomti baby bumps\r\nthrough Lucknow.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd when it’s about to leave,\r\nfor a last look at Chennai,\r\nthe Adyar turns.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the Ravi \r\ncold-presses the cheek\r\nof Lahore that burns."},{"Type":"Bio","Text":"Akhil Katyal grew up in Bareilly and Lucknow and currently lives in New Delhi.
